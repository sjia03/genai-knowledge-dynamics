# stack-exchange

Throughout history, humans have employed various methods to gather and dissem-
inate knowledge. From oral traditions and written texts to libraries and the internet,
the means of knowledge sharing have continually evolved. With the emergence of gen-
erative AI like ChatGPT, how will our online knowledge ecosystems change? I analyze
user engagement on Stack Exchange, a platform covering diverse domains, following
the introduction of ChatGPT in November 2022. I categorize knowledge types into
tacit, explicit, and hybrid, as defined by Polanyiâ€™s paradox. While effects vary across
domains, there is no significant impact on the level of knowledge types.
